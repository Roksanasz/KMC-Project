# KMC-Project
I examined Languimir Asorption. I used the Kinetic Monte Carlo method. Monte Carlo refers to a broad class of algorithms that solve problems through
the use of random numbers. I used that in my c++ code.

For example, I accept a network gas model that can be specified
the adsorption site (NA) and the plants occupied are represented and protected
particle (ND). Number of rows N = NA + NA. Let go of the square web
(adsorption site) with a lottery. Particles from the gas phase can be
adsorbed on the surface at adsorption sites at the rate rA. Whether
desorption process (transition of purified particles to the gas phase)
b will set the rD rate.

The goal of the project was to examine thre cases:  rA/rD = 2, rA/rD = 1 oraz rA/rD = 1/4.
